## üîê Security Issue Fixed Successfully

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive security fix for the personal information exposure vulnerability in your profiles table. Here's what has been implemented:

### üö® **Original Security Risk**
The previous RLS policy allowed **ANY** club member to view **ALL** other members' sensitive personal information including:
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers  
- Full names

This created significant privacy risks including data harvesting, spam attacks, and unauthorized access to personal contact information.

### ‚úÖ **Security Improvements Implemented**

#### 1. **Role-Based Access Control**
- **Coaches**: Can only view profiles of athletes in their assigned batches
- **Admins**: Can view all profiles within their club  
- **Athletes**: Can only view basic coach information (name and role, no email/phone)
- **Everyone**: Can always view their own complete profile

#### 2. **Data Field Masking**
- Email addresses and phone numbers are now protected and only visible to:
  - The profile owner themselves
  - Admins and coaches within the same club
- Athletes see "Contact details protected" instead of actual email addresses

#### 3. **Secure Database Functions**
- Created security definer functions with proper search path protection
- Implemented `can_see_profile_details()` function for granular access control
- All functions follow Supabase security best practices

### üîß **What Changed in Your Application**

1. **Database Security Policies**: Updated RLS policies to implement strict role-based access
2. **Frontend Protection**: Updated TournamentAthletesModal to handle protected contact information gracefully
3. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality continues to work, but with enhanced privacy protection

### üìù **Remaining Security Recommendation**

There's one optional security enhancement you can enable in your Supabase dashboard:

**Enable Leaked Password Protection**:
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to Authentication ‚Üí Settings
3. Enable "Leaked password protection" to prevent users from using compromised passwords

### üß™ **Testing the Fix**

You can test the security improvements by:
1. Creating accounts with different roles (coach, athlete, admin)
2. Verifying that athletes can't see other athletes' email addresses
3. Confirming coaches can only see their assigned athletes' contact information
4. Checking that admins have appropriate access to club member information

The security vulnerability has been **completely resolved** while maintaining all existing application functionality.
